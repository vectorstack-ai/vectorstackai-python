In this section, you will find a set of tutorials that cover the basics of PreciseSearch. 
These tutorials will guide you through a set of complete examples/workflows. 
These practical examples will show you how to use the library, and also provide a template to start building your own applications.


!!! Note "Prerequisites"
    The tutorials assume you have already have a valid API key. 
    If you don't have one yet, you can get it by signing up on the [VectorStackAI](https://vectorstack.ai).
