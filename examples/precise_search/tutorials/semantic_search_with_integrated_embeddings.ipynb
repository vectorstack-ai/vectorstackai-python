    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will build a semantic search application that retrieves the most relevant passages for a given query using **PreciseSearch**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional retrieval setups, which require generating embeddings for both queries and passages, **PreciseSearch** simplifies the process with its integrated embedding modelâ€”eliminating the need to generate embeddings during upsert and search.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Steps\n",
    "1. Setup Knowledge Base â€“ We will use the [MS MARCO dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/microsoft/ms_marco), which contains real Bing search queries paired with relevant passages to construct a knowledge base.\n",
    "2. Skip Embedding Generation â€“ Since PreciseSearch handles embeddings internally, we can skip this step entirely! \n",
    "3. Indexing for Search â€“ Build an efficient search index with PreciseSearch's SDK for fast and accurate retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you'll have a fully functional semantic search system capable of understanding natural language queries. ðŸš€"

In November 1984, Ronald Reagan was reelected in a landslide, defeating Walter Mondale and his running mate Geraldine Ferraro (1935-), the first female vice-presidential candidate from a major U.S. political party.\n",

      "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. A Reagan Democrat is a traditionally Democratic voter in the United States, especially a white working-class Northerner, who defected from their party to support Republican President Ronald Reagan in either or both the 1980 and 1984 elections. During the 1980 election a dramatic number of voters in the U.S., disillusioned with the economic 'malaise' of the 1970s and the presidency of Jimmy Carter (even more than, four years earlier, Liberal Republican Gerald Ford), supported former California governor (and former Democrat) Ronald Reagan.\n",

Yes, he switched parties in 1962. He said that he did not desert the Democrats but rather they deserted him. Yes, Ronald Reagan was a member of the Democratic Party until he s â€¦ witched to the Republican Party in 1962, at the age of 51. 8 people found this useful.\n",

I think Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not. He put us on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it.\n",
